## simple-exchange-app instructions

1. Install the Cocoapods gem: `gem install cocoapods`.
2. Navigate into the Samples/simple-exchange-app-fx directory and run `pod install`.
3. Open simple-exchange-app.xcworkspace (*not* .xcodeproj).

This sample builds frameworks for o365_odata_base and o365_exchange_sdk instead of relying on pods to provide more control.
